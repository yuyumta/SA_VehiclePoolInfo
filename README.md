# SA_VehiclePoolInfo

This tool is basically just an asi version of Nick's, Patrick's, and my AHK script which outputs currently loaded vehicle models and currently loaded (to be streamed into traffic) vehicle IDs. The reason I made this was because the original AHK script had a horrible user interface, whereas with this, it opens a separate command prompt window which displays the data in a more-or-less neat fashion.
Why I chose to write this as a conventional DLL file instead of using https://github.com/DK22Pac/plugin-sdk ? We may never know.
